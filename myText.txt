StarterHacks is an education and collaboration focused hackathon. It is the first of its kind at the University of Waterloo and focuses not only on competition, but on developing a culture of learning and teamwork among first year students and first time hackers. Learn important skills in coding, design and pitching, and tinker with multiple APIs and hardware. It is a place where you can come together to learn, make friends, and create cool new projects. 
We facilitate learning by hosting a set of workshops that will teach you the specific techniques you can use throughout the weekend to excel in your stream. There are a group of motivated mentors who will guide to success, cheer you on and share their knowledge with you.
StarterHacks is taking place from March 3-4, 2018 at the Science Teaching Complex and Quantum Nano Centre, University of Waterloo.
Some partners of StarterHacks include the Investors Group and Mackenzie Investments, Deloitte Digital, UWaterloo Math Endowment Fund, Communitech, HackerEarth, Conrad Business Entrepreneurship and Technology Centre, Velocity, Major League Hacking, Google, and more.
